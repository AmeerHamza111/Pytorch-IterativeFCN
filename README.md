# Iterative fully convolutional neural networks for automatic vertebra segmentation
This is a Pytorch implementation of the paper [Iterative fully convolutional neural networks for automatic vertebra segmentation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1NnlZnjG) accepted in MIDL2018. This paper provides and automatic mechanism for precise vertebrae segmentation on CT images. I create this project for polishing up my knowledge of deep learning in medical image. There is an updated version [Iterative fully convolutional neural networks for automatic vertebra segmentation and identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04383)in 2019 with similiar structure. For the reason of computational cost, I decided to implement the early version in 2018.
